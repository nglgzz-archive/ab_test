# AB Test
In this project I designed an AB test and analyzed its results to decide whether the implementation of
a new feature on Udacity's website would improve the overall experience for its users.

The goal of the project was to learn about different design decisions for an AB test, including metrics to measure,
how long the test should be, ethical principles to consider; and analyzing data coming from said experiment for making a decision.
